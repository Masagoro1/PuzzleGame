Lore:
Jake Yeet, an obvious reference to the popular artist Yeet and not anyone else who attends SFU (Jake Yee), wants to go on a mind-boggling journey!
He packs some asian pears and some band-aids and sets out. 
Jake must traverse hard challenges and tribulations. Can he make it to the top of the mountain?

How the game works:
As normal, WASD is for the player's movement. However, we added another level of complexity to the movement - directional cameras with the arrow keys.
We implemented the movement in such a way such that it is relative to the player's direction. For example, let us say the player is facing North.
If we press the left-arrow key, the camera will rotate around the player until it points West since the left-arrow key means West relative to North.
If we pressed the left-arrow key while the camera is pointing South, the camera would then point East. The camera rotation is relative, but so is the movement.
If the camera is facing West, pressing "a" would move the player cardinally South as "a" represents relative left when looking absolute West.

How this connects with the theme - With a new perspective:
Changing the camera rotation and relative movement fits the theme very well as everytime the camera is switch, 
the more information you gain in the level as there are elements within that are obscured from the player in certain camera angles.

Ending of game:
At the end of the game, Jake reaches the top of the mountain.


Solution to puzzles:
Level 1:
First, use your arrow keys to rotate to the side and use WASD to navigate through the first door. 
Once in the second room, use the up arrow key to go into the top-down view and you will see a a green square - this is the hint to the puzzle.
You must navigate through the door that has the matching shape as seen on the floor.
Go through this door and you wil reach the exit

Level 2:
Press "f" near buttons. There are four trees with four different shapes on top and roman numerals on the bark. 
The roman numerals corresponds to which order in the sequence you press the buttons. 
Ex. Tree with circle on top has "IV" on its bark, so press the button associate with it 4th.
